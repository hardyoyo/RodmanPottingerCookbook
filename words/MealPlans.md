# Meal Plans

We'll try to outline a few plans for multiple-dish meals, to help you prepare
for a big day of cooking!

## Ethiopian Feast !

Cooking a bunch of Ethiopian food all at once can feel a bit daunting, your
kitchen will be a whirlwind of spices and chopped veggies! Here's a plan we've
used that has worked well.

1. Start [Misir Wot](#misir-wot) (see page \pageref{misir-wot}) in the Instant Pot.
   This is basically fire and forget, so get it going, then work on the rest.
2. If you're feeling really lazy, the only other thing you need to make is a
   salad. Chop or tear some fresh lettuce, chop some tomato wedges, use lemon
   juice and a dash of salt as a dressing. Add more veggies if you have 'em
   (maybe a bit of the red onion from the Misir Wot?).
3. If you have some greens of some sort (Kale, Mustard, Collard) You can make
   [Gomen Be'telba](#gomen-be-telba) (see page \pageref{gomen-be-telba}) or Ye'Tikil
   Gomen Be'karot.
4. Roasting some veggies is a really easy way to add another dish to this feast.
   Chop up some carrots and potatoes, and zucchini if you have any, set the oven
   on 425Â°F, coat a roasting pan or glas baking dish with a bit of olive oil,
   sprinkle more olive oil on the veggies and toss them, sprinkle some salt,
   pepper, roasted garlic powder, and berbere (careful with the last one, it's
   *the* spice for Ethiopian food, but it's also spicy hot).

That's it, that's the plan: Misir Wot, then one or two other dishes. If you want
to really explore Ethiopian Cuisine, we recommend the book Teff Love by Kittee
Berns.

## Holidays

Having a bunch of people over for a big holiday meal has some unique logistics
challenges. You'll probably ask folks to bring a side dish, however, assuming
you're a vegetarian, someone is going to want to bring meat. And it's nearly
certain someone is going to bring something that needs to pop into the oven at
some point. So, your goal is to move as many things as you can into crock pots,
or an instant pot or rice cooker in slow cooker mode.

Instead of typing up a plan, I'm going to paste a scan of the handwritten notes
from Debbie, which we've used for years. This will hopefully inspire you to make
your own plan, or you can just borrow ours.
