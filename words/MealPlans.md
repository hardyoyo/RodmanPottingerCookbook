# Meal Plans

We'll try to outline a few plans for multiple-dish meals, to help you prepare
for a big day of cooking!

## Ethiopian Feast !

Cooking a bunch of Ethiopian food all at once can feel a bit daunting, your
kitchen will be a whirlwind of spices and chopped veggies! Here's a plan we've
used that has worked well.

1. Start [Misir Wot](#misir-wot) in the Instant Pot. This is basically fire and forget, so get
   it going, then work on the rest.
2. If you're feeling really lazy, the only other thing you need to make is a
   salad. Chop or tear some fresh lettuce, chop some tomato wedges, use lemon
   juice and a dash of salt as a dressing. Add more veggies if you have 'em
   (maybe a bit of the red onion from the Misir Wot?).
3. If you have some greens of some sort (Kale, Mustard, Collard) You can make
   [Gomen Be'telba](#gomen-be-telba) or Ye'Tikil Gomen Be'karot.

That's it, that's the plan: Misir Wot, then one or two other dishes. If you want
to really explore Ethiopian Cuisine, we recommend the book Teff Love by Kittee
Berns.
