# Meal Plans

We'll try to outline a few plans for multiple-dish meals, to help you prepare
for a big day of cooking!

## Ethiopian Feast !

Cooking a bunch of Ethiopian food all at once can feel a bit daunting, but you
can do it, it'll be fun! Your kitchen will be a whirlwind of spices and chopped
veggies! Here's a plan we've used that has worked well.

1. Start [Misir Wot](#misir-wot) (see page \pageref{misir-wot}) in the Instant Pot.
   This is basically fire and forget, so get it going, then work on the rest.
2. If you're feeling really lazy, the only other thing you need to make is a
   salad. Chop or tear some fresh lettuce, chop some tomato wedges, use lemon
   juice and a dash of salt as a dressing. Add more veggies if you have 'em
   (maybe a bit of the red onion from the Misir Wot?).
3. If you have some greens of some sort (Kale, Mustard, Collard) You can make
   [Gomen Be'telba](#gomen-be-telba) (see page \pageref{gomen-be-telba}) or if
   you have cabbage, you can make Ye'Tikil Gomen Be'Karot (see page
   \pageref{ye-tikil-gomen-be-karot}).
4. Roasting some veggies is a really easy way to add another dish to this feast.
   Chop up some carrots and potatoes, and zucchini if you have any, set the oven
   on 425°F, coat a roasting pan or glass baking dish with a bit of olive oil,
   sprinkle more olive oil on the veggies and toss them, sprinkle some salt,
   pepper, roasted garlic powder, and berbere (careful with the last one, it's
   *the* spice for Ethiopian food, but it's also spicy hot). Roast for about
   20-30 minutes.

That's it, that's the plan: Misir Wot, then one or two other dishes. If you want
to really explore Ethiopian Cuisine, we recommend the book _Teff Love_ by Kittee
Berns.

## Fancy Ass Pasta !

This is super easy, but involves a lot of moving parts, so here's the plan.

1. Start boiling two pots of water for pasta choices. One for gluten-free
   noodles, one for regular noodles.
2. Get stuff ready: 2 glass bowls for the pasta, pasta forks, collander in the
   sink, all plastic stuff out of the sink.
3. Slice and sauté some add-ins: mushrooms are good, so is spinach. For the
   spinach, add some olive oil and garlic, and a splash of Braggs.
4. Water is probably boiling, the gluten-free noodles will be done faster
   than the regular noodles, so start them first.
5. Set a timer for the GF noodles. The time will be on the package.
6. Make sauce (see Creamy Pesto Sauce, on page \pageref{creamy-pesto-sauce}).
7. If making a sauce feels overwhelming at this point, it's cool, just heat up
   some red sauce from a jar. It'll all be great. Actually, you can do both,
   mixing sauces is fun and tasty.
8. When the timer goes off for the GF pasta, dump it into the collander, then
   transfer to a glass bowl.
9. Put about half of the sauce on the GF pasta, and let your GF eaters know it's
   ready, because GF pasta needs to be eaten quickly. But don't forget the other
   pot of noodles!
10. The other pasta should be ready, dump it into the collander, then transfer
    to another glass bowl.
11. Put the other half of the sauce on the regular pasta. Let everyone know food
    is ready to eat. Put add-ins in serving bowls if you want to be fancy about it.
12. Enjoy, you've earned it.

Warm bread really sends this one over the top. If you have some french bread
and/or GF french bread, definitely work that into the plan. I'd recommend
pre-heating the oven first. I'd probably put the bread in at step 2.

Like I said, lots of moving parts. But worth it.

## Holidays

Having a bunch of people over for a big holiday meal has some unique challenges.
You'll probably ask folks to bring a side dish, however, assuming you're a
vegetarian, someone is going to want to bring meat. And it's nearly certain
someone is going to bring something that needs to pop into the oven at some
point. So, your goal is to move as many things as you can into crock pots,
or an instant pot or rice cooker in slow cooker mode.

Instead of typing up a plan, I'm going to paste a scan of the handwritten notes
from Debbie, which we've used for years. This will hopefully inspire you to make
your own plan, or you can just borrow ours.
