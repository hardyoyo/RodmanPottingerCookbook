# Essential Tools for your Kitchen

Wooden Spoons
: You'll need at least one, and we recommend having a variety. One basic spoon
shape for stirring, and one with a flat-ish surface, like a spatula, sometimes
referred to as a "spoonula", is perfect for saut√©ing. Keep these in a large jar
of some sort, near your stove, so they're handy when you remember you need one.
