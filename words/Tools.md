# Essential Tools for your Kitchen

Wooden Spoons
: You'll need at least one, and we recommend having a variety. One basic spoon
shape for stirring, and one with a flat-ish surface, like a spatula, sometimes
referred to as a "spoonula", is perfect for saut√©ing. Keep these in a large jar
of some sort, near your stove, so they're handy when you remember you need one.

Mixing Bowls
: At least a large and medium-sized bowl, glass is kinda heavy, steel is fine 
and probably cheaper. Avoid plastic. Most sets you get will have a good mix of 
sizes, but be sure there is one big enough for you to mix up a batch of cookie 
dough, or spaghetti pancake.

Spatulas
: a plastic one is good for non-stick pans, a metal one is nicer (the edge is 
sharper), but should only be used on stainless steel pans, or on cast iron.
