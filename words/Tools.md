# Essential Tools for your Kitchen

Wooden Spoons
: You'll need at least one, and we recommend having a variety. One basic spoon
shape for stirring, and one with a flat-ish surface, like a spatula, sometimes
referred to as a "spoonula", is perfect for saut√©ing. Keep these in a large jar
of some sort, near your stove, so they're handy when you remember you need one.

Mixing Bowls
: At least a large and medium-sized bowl, glass is kinda heavy, steel is fine 
and probably cheaper. Avoid plastic. Most sets you get will have a good mix of 
sizes, but be sure there is one big enough for you to mix up a batch of cookie 
dough, or spaghetti pancake.

Spatulas
: A plastic one is good for non-stick pans, a metal one is nicer (the edge is 
sharper), but should only be used on stainless steel pans, or on cast iron.

Plastic Scrapers
: A plastic scraper is the perfect tool for cleaning up cast iron pans, it is
also handy for getting all sorts of other kitchen things clean, like spatulas
with gunk stuck to them, etc. You need at least one, but we recommend getting a
bunch, because they're easy to lose.
