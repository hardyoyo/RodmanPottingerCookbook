# Instant Pot vs. Rice Cooker

For most purposes, these appliances are interchangeable. You can use the same
recipes for each, just know that you can't pressure cook with a rice cooker. But
they both have similar buttons, and the ratio of water to ingredients is going
to be the same for either appliance.

They both have a sauté button, which makes soups and sauces really easy.

## What the Rice Cooker does well

* white rice (comes out perfectly fluffy)
* oatmeal (ditto, perfect)
* the pot is non-stick, which makes it easier to clean (with caution)
* it has a bit of smarts, it's not just time-based cooking, it has a sensor to
determine whether to stop cooking. This also means it has a small water catcher
that you'll need to empty after you use it.
* approved for use in many college dorms ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## What the Instant Pot does well

* brown rice (comes out softer, better texture)
* pressure cooking is typically slightly faster than the Rice Cooker
* the sauté seems to have slightly more 'oomph' than the Rice Cooker
* the pot is stainless steel, and can take a lot more abuse
