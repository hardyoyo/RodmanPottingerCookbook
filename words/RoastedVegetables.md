# Roasted Vegetables

Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Grab some parchment paper--*not* waxed paper... if 
you try to roast waxed paper, *you will set a fire*, and it'll smell really 
gross. Or you can use a silcone cookie sheet liner, but they'll char up more 
than you may like. Parchment paper can take the abuse, and you will throw it 
away when you're done with it.

Chop your veggies into the size indicated in the chart below, and add to a bowl.
Drizzle some olive oil on the veggies, then sprinkle with a bit of salt. You can
also add other powdered spices (cumin, garlic powder, chilli powder), but don't
go too crazy, probably just salt is fine. Whatever, it's going to be delicious
no matter what. Place pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Stir
occasionally and cook until tender and lightly browned.
