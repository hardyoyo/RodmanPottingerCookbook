The quanity column above might be confusing, it just means: make at least 2 C 
for these ratios. The "perfect for 5" column already does the math for you, and 
should be roughly correct. It'll feed 5 people. You'll probably have leftovers, 
but that's OK, leftovers are awesome! If you're cooking for fewer people, maybe 
start with the basic ratio and then work from there if you find you haven't 
cooked enough. Trust your gut, though, if you think you need more food, double 
it.
