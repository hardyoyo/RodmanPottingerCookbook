water to stop the cooking process

briefly on fire

Julienne

dusted with flour and sauteed in butter

Natural Release
: For a pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot, a Natural Release is "lazier" than
a quick release. You just let the cooker sit about 15-20 minutes. When you open
the vent, no pressure is released, just a bit of steam. You do this if you
aren't in a hurry, or if you want to ensure whatever you're cooking is really
done. Many beans, soups, sauces all call for a natural release, to ensure they
are well-cooked. (see also Quick Release)

Parbake
: to pre-bake food such as pizza crust or pie crust, so that it can be frozen
and more easily used at a later time

Parboil
: to precook foods by boiling for a short time

Quick Release
: For a pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot, a Quick Release is when you open
the vent to release the pressure and steam. It'll be noisy and hot so move your
hand back as soon as you open the vent! You do this if you're in a hurry to eat
or use whatever it is you have in the cooker. (see also Natural Release)

Reduce
: to thicken a liquid mixture by boiling or simmering, causing moisture to i
evaporate

Scald
: to heat a liquid just to the boiling point
