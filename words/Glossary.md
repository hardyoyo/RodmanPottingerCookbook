# Glossary of Cooking Terms

Quick Release
: For a pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot, a Quick Release is when you open
the vent to release the pressure and steam. It'll be noisy and hot so move your
hand back as soon as you open the vent! You do this if you're in a hurry to eat
or use whatever it is you have in the cooker.

Natural Release
: For a pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot, a Natural Release is "lazier" than
a quick release. You just let the cooker sit about 15-20 minutes. When you open
the vent, no pressure is released, just a bit of steam. You do this if you 
aren't in a hurry, or if you want to ensure whatever you're cooking is really
done. Many beans, soups, sauces all call for a natural release, to ensure they
are well-cooked.
