# Gluten-Free, Vegan Waffles

*gluten free, vegan, breakfast*

**6 Servings**

---

- *2 T* ground flaxseed
- *5 T* water
-- *2 C* all-purpose gluten-free flour blend
- *1 T* sugar
- *1 t* baking powder
- *1/4 t* salt
- *1/2 t* vanilla extract
 *1 3/4 C* dairy-free milk (soy works well)
- *1/2 C* vegetable oil

---

In a medium bowl, mix the flaxseed and water, set aside. In a large bowl, add all
the dry ingredients, and whisk until combined. In your medium bowl with your
"flax eggs", add all the rest of the wet ingredients. Mix wet ingredients until
they are combined. Plug in your waffle iron and let it preheat. Mix the bowl of
wet stuff into the large bowl of dry stuff, until the batter is smooth. Don't be
obsessive about the smoothness, just don't have any huge clumps of dry stuff.
You can usually tell when a waffle iron is ready becuase the light on it will
turn off. When the iron is ready, scoop about 1/4 C of batter onto the waffle
iron, and close the iron. Each waffle will take about 3 minutes to cook. You can
set a timer if you want, but the light on the iron is designed to help you, so
you can just watch the light if you prefer. When it turns off, open the waffle
iron and gently/carefully get it out of the iron and onto a plate (a fork can
help with this). Repeat unitl all batter is used up. If the waffles seem to be
getting weirdly thick, you can add a spoon-full of water to the batter to thin
it out.

gluten-free folks... there's probably no way to clean all the gluten off of a
waffle iron that has been used to cook waffles made with wheat flour.*
