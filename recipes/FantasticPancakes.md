*breakfast, vegan*

**5 Servings**

- *3 C* Wheat Flour (or Gluten Free if you want)
- *1/8 C* Sugar

Mix dry ingredients in a medium bowl, mix wet in a small bowl, dump the wet in
with the dry, mix together with a wooden spoon, but not too much, a few lumps
are fine. Pour on to a hot griddle or a big skillet if you don't have a griddle.
Go for about 3-4 in. pancakes, they're fun to eat with your fingers. Or make
shapes if you need to entertain people, or yourself.

## Options

You can substitute Gluten Free flour if you're cooking for someone with a gluten
sensitivity or preference. You can substitute 2 eggs if you don't have the flax
seeds, or don't care about being vegan, but, you really should have flax seeds 
handy.
