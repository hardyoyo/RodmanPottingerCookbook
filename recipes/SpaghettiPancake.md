# Spaghetti Pancake

*dinner*

**5 Servings**

What's that? You boiled too many noodles? Put them in the fridge and have them
for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner).

---

- *4 C* cooked spaghetti noodles
- *2* eggs
- *2 T* milk
- *1/4 C* parmesan cheese
- *1/4 t* oregano
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- *1 dash* cayenne pepper (optional)
- *2 t* margarine or olive oil

---

In a big bowl, lightly beat the eggs, add the milk, cheese and spices, mix well,
then add the noodles, and mix again, until the noodles are coated. In a large
skillet, heat the margarine or olive oil. Add the spaghetti mixture, spreading
it evenly to form a tight cake. Cook pancake over medium-low heat until its
bottom is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Divide the pancake into 4 sectors, and
turn it one section at a time. Brown the pancake on the other side, 3-5 minutes.
Serve with ketchup.
