# Spicy Lentils

from http://www.thefresh20.com/

*staple, vegan, Instant Pot*

**4 Servings**

---

- *2 T* Olive Oil
- *4* carrots, diced
- *1* onion, diced
- *4* garlic cloves, minced (use jared minced garlic, it's easy)
- *1* chipotle pepper in adobo, minced (freeze the leftovers, makes it easier to handle)
- *2 T* tomato paste (freeze the leftovers in 2T chunks)
- *1 t* Cumin
- *1* bay leaf
- *3-4 C* vegetable broth (just enough to cover the lentils)
- *2 C* brown lentils
- *2 T* lime juice

---

Hit the saute button, add oil, saute onion and carrots for 3-4 minutes. Add
garlic, saute for 30 more seconds. Add chipotle, tomato paste, cumin, saute for
1 minute. Stir well. Add lentils, bay leaf, and enough broth to just cover the
lentils, put on cover, hit manual button, set for 15 minutes. When the cooker
beeps, do a natural release... or a quick release, it doesn't matter, these are
lentils. When you have the lid open, stir in the lime juice.

### USES, NOTES 

Taco filling, salad topping, or tear up some kale and put it in a tortilla to
make an awesome wrap. I recommend goddess dressing with a splash of Sriracha as
a sauce for the wrap.

If you can only find a 7 oz. can of Chipotle peppers, don't fret, just chop the
entire can, then keep the extra in a small jar in the fridge, because I can
guarantee you'll make this recipe again.
