**8 Servings**

---

- *2 C* chickpeas (canned is fine)
- *1/2 C* tahin
- *1/4 C* olive oil, plus oil for drizzling
- *2 t* garlic, minced
- salt and pepper, to taste
- *1 T* ground cumin, paprika or chili powder
- *1 T* lemon juice
- chopped fresh parsley leaves, optional, for garnish

---

Put everything except the parsley in a food processor or blender and begin to
process. If it seems too thick add a bit of water as needed, until the hummus is
smooth and the consistency you're aiming for. If it ends up to liquid-y, don't
worry, it'll firm up in the fridge. Taste and adjust the seasoning. If you want
to be fancy when you serve this, granish with parsley, but this is totally
optional. Serve with carrots or pita chips, or gluten-free crackers or pretzels,
or whatever, you know what hummus is for. NOTE: it's the *best* food fight
weapon you can ever imagine.
