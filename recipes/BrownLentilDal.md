*Indian, instant pot, spicy*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 t* olive oil
- *1 C* brown lentils
- *4 C* water
- *6 t* garlic, minced
- *1/2 t* red pepper flakes (divided)
- *1 t* salt
- *1/4 C* ghee (or 2 T oil + 2 T butter)
- *1/2* onion, thinly sliced
- *1/2 t* whole cumin seeds

Add 1 t of olive oil to the cooker, set to sauté and add 3t garlic, sauté  until
it's fragrant, then add 1/4 t of red pepper flakes, water, and lentils. Lock the
lid, press the bean/chili button and adjust time for 15 minutes.

While the lentils are cooking, thinly slice the onions. When the lentils are
cooked, allow them to release the steam naturally, or if you're in a hurry to
eat, do a quick release.

Heat the ghee in a small skillet. Add the onions and let them cook for 3-4
minutes over medium heat stirring so the onions start to brown evenly. Add the
remaining garlic, cumin seeds, and another 1/2-3/4 t red pepper flakes.
Continue to stir the oil and cook for another 2-4 minutes or until the onions
start to just brown and the garlic is fragrant and deepens in color a bit. Pour
the hot ghee/oil along with the onions and garlic mixture into the dal. Stir to
combine. Season with the salt. Stir and adjust salt to taste. Serve warm over
basmati rice. You probably want a salad with this.
