Saut√© the onion and garlic with the oil in a skillet for 3 minutes. Add the
cumin and water and continue for 1 minute. Add the sweet potato and beans,
stir, cover and cook for about 6 minutes or until the sweet potato is tender
but not mushy. Remove skillet from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Start a
new skillet (probalby either non-stick or cast iron), medium heat. After the
mixture has cooled for a minute or so, spread some on about half of a  tortilla.
Sprinkle with cheese if you're using it. Fold the tortilla in half and lay it
gently in the hot skillet. Cook each side for about 2 minutes, until the cheese
is melty and the filling is warm. Serve with salsa and sour cream.

Tips:

- You can sprinkle some whole cumin seeds on the skillet before you place
the torilla in. It keeps the tortilla from sticking, and it adds a nice touch.
- If you don't have a food processor, you can still make this, but it's more work.
You can shred the sweet potato with a cheese grater. It totally works, I
promise, that's how we used to make this.
