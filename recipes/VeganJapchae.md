Bring a large pot of water to a boil, cook noodles according to the directions
on the package. Drain and rinse the noodles in cool water. Add 1t sesame oil to
coat the noodles, then use scissors to cut the noodles (around 3-4 times). In
the same pot, add the spinach and blanch for 30 seconds. Rinse with cold water
and squeeze excess liquid out using a towel. Chop the bundled up spinach in
half. Slice all the vegetables into match stick sized pieces (or as close as you
can get, bigger is OK, as long as they are roughly the same size). Cut the tofu
in to thin recangles. Put the Tamari, water, and sesame oil in a small bowl and 
stir. In a large skillet or wok, over medium heat, fry the tofu with a splash of
sesame oil until lightly browned on each side. Transfer to another bowl and set
aside. In the same skillet/wok, fry the onions and garlic for 1 minute. Then add
in the mushrooms and carrot, fry for a minute. Add in the zucchini and
scallions, fry for another minute. Turn down the heat a bit, add in the noodles,
spinach, tofu and sauce. Toss and cook until the sauce is all soaked up. Serve
and garnish with sesame seeds.
