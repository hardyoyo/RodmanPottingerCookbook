# Biga (Italian bread starter)

From _The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook_ by Beth Hensperger

*bread machine*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 2/3 C* warm water
- *1/2 t* bread machine yeast
- *3 3/4 C* unbleached all-purpose or bread flour

---

Place water and yeast in the bread pan. Add the flour. Program machine for
dough cycle and press start. Immediately set a timer for 10 minutes. When timer
rings, press stop and unplug the machine. You will have a stiff dough ball that
will loosen and become moist as it sits. Let starter sit in machine for about
six hours. Prepare a plastic container (~1qt.), spraying sides, top, bottom
with oil spray. Label with the date and refrigerate. Can keep for up to 2
weeks. You can also freeze in 1/4 cup chunks (this is what I recommend, it
helps with laziness).

Use Biga to make [Semolina Country Bread](./SemolinaCountryBread.md) (see page
\pageref{SemolinaCountryBread}).
