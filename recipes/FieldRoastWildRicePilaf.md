# Field Roast Wild Rice Pilaf

Hardy invented this as a way to use Field Roast, which had until that point had
stymied us. It contributes a lot of the flavor profile for this pilaf. You can
use a Beyond Meat brat, for a gluten-free version. Or you can serve it with both
Field Roast and a Beyond Brat on the side, let people choose.

- *2 T* olive oil
- *1* large onion, chopped
- *1 t* garlic, minced (optional)
- *1* package of Field Roast Smoked Apple Sage Sausage, chopped

Sauté onion in the cooker. Add garlici (if you're using it). Add field roast
sauté a minute more. Add rice, brown a bit more (3 or 4 minutes), stirring
constantly. Add water and bouillon, put on the lid, lock it, cook for 20
minutes, let it natural release.

If you need to avoid gluten, you should substitute a Beyond Meat Brat for the
Field Roast. OR, you can make both the Field Roast and the Beyond Brat in
different skillets, and serve them on the side, let folks pick their poison.
