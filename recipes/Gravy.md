# Five Minute Gluten-Free Gravy

*sauce, gluten-free*

**8 Servings**

---

- *2 C* water
- *2 t* better than bouilion
- *1/4 C* all-purpose gluten-free flour
- *1/4 C* butter/margarine
- salt and pepper to taste

---

Place all ingredients in a small sauce pan and heat over medium heat. Whisk
constantly. When your gravy starts to boil, whisk until all the ingredients are
combined and your gravy is smooth. Remove from heat and cool to desired
temperature before serving. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the
fridge for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months. Hints: start with cold
ingredients. Put all the ingredients in the pot, THEN turn on the heat. That's
how you keep the flour from clumping.
