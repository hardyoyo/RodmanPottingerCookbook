from _Korean Vegetarian Cooking_ by Shin Kim

*korean, soup*

**8 Servings**

---

- *4 T* Korean fermented soybean paste (doenjang)
- *2 T* toasted sesame seed oil
- *4 t* garlic, minced
- *2* medium potatoes, peeled and cut into small dice
- *2* medium zucchini, cut into small dice
- *8* oz. of button mushrooms, cut into medium dice
- *7-8 C* vegetable stock, or water and bouilion
- *1* block of extra firm tofu, pressed and cut into medium dice
- *1* jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced, optional, for garnish
- Jasmine rice, for serving

---

In a medium pot, combine the soybean paste, sesame oil, and garlic, stir to mix.
Slowly bring the paste mix to a soft sizzle over low heat. Add the potato,
zucchini and mushrooms, stir to coat vegetables. Add stock/water and bring to
boil over medium heat. Cook until the potato is soft, about 10 minutes. Check
often, skim off any foam if it's worrisome, but usually there's not any foam,
and it's no big deal if there's a little bit of foam. Add tofu, bring to boil
again, remove from heat, serve hot with rice, garnish with peppers for anyone
who wants to add some heat or a tasty/peppery crunch.

> ![info](./images/info-icon.png) *This soup has a reputation for being
"stinky", mostly because the soybean paste can have a very powerful smell,
especially when you're starting out with the soup. It will quickly moderate, and
smell really amazing. Trust us. Some versions of soybean paste have been
moderated for western kitchens, but, really, if it smells like a lot, that's a
good sign, you're cooking with authentic Korean soybean paste. Gaja!*
