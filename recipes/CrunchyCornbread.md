# Crunchy Cornbread

*quickbread*

**8-12 Servings**

---

- *1 1/2 C* milk
- *3 T* flaxseeds (ground)
- *3 T* oil
- *2 T* maple syrup
- *1 C* spelt flour (or gluten-free flour)
- *1 C* cornmeal
- *1/2 t* salt
- *2 1/2 t* baking powder

---

Preheat oven to 400Â°F. In a small bowl, combine milk, flaxseeds, oil and maple
syrup. In a medium bowl combine flour, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder. Add
liquid mixture to flour mixture and combine thoroughly with minimal mixing (a
wooden spoon would be great for this). If you're using gluten-free flour, you
may need to add about 1/2 C more milk at this point, if the batter seems very
thick (nearly impossible to mix). You're aiming for something closer to cake
batter, not biscotti. Pour the batter into an oiled 8 inch square pan. Bake for
30 minutes or until cornbread pulls away from the sides, and a dent made by a
finger in the center of the loaf recovers its shape--but you probably won't
need to do that test, we never do, don't poke your bread if you don't have to.
As muffins, this recipe makes a dozen, and cooks in 16 minutes.
