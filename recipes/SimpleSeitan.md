# Simple Seitan

From Veganomicon, pgs 131-132. This is really fun to make: smells good, and you
get to squish things with your fingers: satisfying! But, you know, it's
obviously made almsot entirely of gluten, so only cook this when your
gluten-sensitive family members or friends aren't around. And then clean up
right away!

Mix together the gluten flour and yeast in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, mix
together the veggie broth, soy sauce, olive oil and garlic. Pour the wet into
the dry and stir with a wooden spoon until most of the moisture has been
absorbed and the wet ingredients are partially clumped together with the dry
ingredients. Use your hands to knead the mixture for about 3 minutes, until the
dough is elastic. Divide with a knife into 6-9 equal pieces, then knead those
pieces in your hand just to stretch them out a bit. Then fill a large stock pot
with water, bouillon, soy sauce, and gluten pieces. Cover an bring to a boil,
but watch carefully, you don't want it to boil for very long or the outside of
the seitan will be spongy. Try to catch it as soon as it boils and then lower
the heat as low as it will go so that it's at a low simmer. Partialy cover the
pot so that steem can escape and lit simmer for an hour. You can turn the pieces
occasionally if you feel like it, but it's not necessary. After an hour, turn
off the heat, take off the lid, and let it sit for 15 minutes. Use tongs to
remove the seitan from the broth, place each piece in a strainer until they're
cool enough to handle. You can slice them up and use them now, or you can store
them in the fridge (with about 1/2 C of broth per container), or freeze them.

You *can* use an instant pot for this recipe, but only like a slow cooker, don't
close the vent, and don't let it come up to pressure. Probably use the saut√©
button to get things up to boiling faster, then switch to Slow Cook for the
simmer.
