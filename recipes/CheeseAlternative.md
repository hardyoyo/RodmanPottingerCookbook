# Quick-Soaked Cashew Cheese Alternative

*staple*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 C* raw cashews
- *2 T* nutritional yeast
- *1 T* lemon juice
- *1/2 t* salt
- *1/4 t* garlic powder
- *1/4 t* onion powder
- *1/2 C* water

---

Place the raw cashews in a microwave-safe bowl and cover them with water.
Microwave the cashews on high power for 2 minutes. Drain the cashews and
rinse them under cold water to cool them down (skip this step if you're
going to use this right away and want it warm anyway). In a blender or
food processor, combine the quick-soaked cashews, nutritional yeast,
lemon juice, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and water. Blend the
ingredients until smooth and creamy, adding more water if needed to
achieve the desired consistency.

This stuff doesn't *melt* so, you'll want to keep it warm, and then top
whatever you're adding "cheese" to, like a pizza, or a casserole, after
it has finished cooking and is still warm. If you're going for "drizzle"
be sure to add enough water to the "cheese" so it'll actually do that.
