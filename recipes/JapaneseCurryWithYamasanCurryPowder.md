# Japanese Curry with Yamasan Curry Powder

*gluten-free, curry, Japanese, Instant Pot*

**8 Servings**

---

- *1 T* olive oil
- *2 t* garlic, minced
- *2* potatoes, cubed
- *1* package of tofu, pressed and cubed
- *1* large onion, chopped in large chunks
- *1* carrot, chopped in large chunks
- *1* bell pepper (not green), chopped in large chunks
- *2 C* vegetable stock
- *6 T* Yamasan Gluten-Free Curry Powder (half the package)
- *1/2 t* Curry Powder
- *1 t* Yondu or GF Soy Sauce

---

Chop all the things that need chopping. Press the Sauté button on the cooker,
adjust it to medium heat, add the olive oil and the Yondu or soy sauce, sauté
the tofu until it's a little brown, but not crispy. While you're sauté-ing it,
sprinkle on some curry powder (up to 1/2 t is good, but however much you want).
When it's done, set the tofu aside, possibly on a paper towel to soak up the
extra oil, but that's not totally necessary. Sauté the onions until they're a
bit brown around the edges, add the garlic, sauté for about 30 seconds more,
add the carrots and peppers, sauté for 2 minutes. Add tofu back, then the
potatoes, and the vegetable stock. Stir in the Yamasan GF Curry Powder. Put the 
lid on the cooker, press the manual button and set it for 7-10 minutes (longer
time equals softer veggies and thicker sauce). Natural release. Serve over rice.

start chopping veggies for this. Jasmine cooks faster. But if you have leftover
rice in the fridge, any sort will do.*
