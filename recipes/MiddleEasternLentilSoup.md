Start by peeling and chopping the onions and potatoes into large chunks. If you
don't want to blend the soup at the end, then dice them into smaller cubes. In
the Instant Pot, add the vegetable oil, potatoes, onions, and spices and cook
for 5 minutes on sauté mode. If using stove top, use a regular soup pot. Add the
lentils and water, mix well ensuring you scrape the bottom of the pot, and
secure the instant pot lid. If using stove top, cover the poti. If using
Instant Pot, pressure cook for 15 minutes. The Instant Pot will take
approximately 10-15 minutes to come to pressurei. If using stove top, allow it
to boil for 40-60 minutes until the vegetables are soft.  Adjust the liquid
and salt half way through. For the Instant Pot, manually release the pressure
valve and blend the soup using an immersion blender. For the stove top, you can 
leave it chunky or blend it as well. Taste and adjust the salt and also the
water. If you like it thinner, add more water and allow it to cook for a few
more minutes on sauté mode.
