Don't miss that you aren't using all the water at first, you are aiming to cook
the lentils into a thick paste, then thinning it to the consistency you want.

ginger and garlic. Mix well and cook for 30 seconds. Add red lentils, berbere
spice blend, and salt. Add **2 cups** of water and mix everything together. Close
Instant Pot lid with pressure valve to sealing. Cook on Manual for 15 minutes
