*side, potluck*

**5 Servings**

---

- *2 Lb* very small potatoes
- dash of salt
- *4 T* lemon juice
- grated zest of lemon
- *1 t* garlic, minced
- *1 t* salt
- *1 t* fancy mustard
- *4 T* olive oil
- black pepper

Place the potatoes in a saucepan with enough boiling water to cover them, add
some salt, and simmer them for about 15-20 minutes. Make the dressing:
Mix the garlic and salt, then whisk in everything except the chives and green
onion. When the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and transfer them
to a serving bowl. Pour on the vinaigrette dressing while they are still hot,
toss them around in the dressing to get a good coating, then finally scatter in
the chives and green onion, and serve.

You can always steam the potatoes in an instant pot if you're in hurry or are
feeling lazy.
