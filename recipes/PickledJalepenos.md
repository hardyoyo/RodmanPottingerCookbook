*condiment*

**20 Servings**

---

- *6* jalapeno peppers, sliced
- *1/2 C* distilled white vinegar
- *1/2 C* water
- *1 t* garlic, minced
- *1* carrot, chopped (optional)
- *1 t* salt
- *1 t* Agave syrup
- *5* whole black peppercorns
- *1* pint mason jar

---

Gather all ingredients. Slice the peppers, mix with chopped carrot, and pack
them into a clean 1 pint mason jar. Combine liquids, salt, agave syrup and
peppercorns in a small pan, bring to boil over medium heat. Carefully pour
brine solution over peppers (probably do this in the sink, so splashes aren't a
big deal). Let stand, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Seal the jar with a
tight-fitting lid and shake well. Refrigerate until flavor develops, at least
one hour or up to two weeks, before serving. Keep refrigerated. Will keep as
long as normal pickles (many months) as long as you keep them refrigerated. Use
these as garnish on tacos, sandwiches, salads, or soup.
