Preheat oven to 350Â°F and grease one large 13x9 cake pan. If you're using two 
round cake pans, you should lightly dust them with flour in addition to 
greasing them. Those round pans like to hold on to their cake! Measure 1 C 
unsweetened almond milk and add the tablespoon of vinegar to it. Stir slightly 
and set aside to curdle. In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, 
baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk well to combine. Now add the oil, 
applesauce, vanilla and almond milk/vinegar mixture. Mix on medium speed with a 
hand mixer (or stand mixer with the paddle attachment) until well combined.
Lower the speed and carefully pour in the boiling water, continuing to mix into 
the cake batter until combined. The batter will seem very runny at this point; 
that is how it should be, trust me! Divide the batter evenly between your cake 
pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes 
out clean. After 10 minutes of cooling in the pan, if you're using round cake
pans, carefully remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely before 
frosting.

FOR THE CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING
Add the cup of cocoa powder to a large bowl (I just wipe out the cake bowl and 
use it for the frosting). Whisk well to remove any clumps. Add the softened 
vegan butter and mix with a hand mixer until creamed and well combined. Add 
half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk, and mix until combined. 
Add the rest of the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Mix starting on low, 
and turn to high. Mix until fluffy and combined.
