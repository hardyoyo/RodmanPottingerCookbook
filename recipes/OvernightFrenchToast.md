but we've dialed back the fat and sugar, because, really.

For the French toast: Grease the baking pan with butter. Tear the bread into
chunks, or cut into cubes, and evenly distribute in the pan. Crack the eggs in
a big bowl. Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar
and vanilla. Pour evenly over the bread. Cover the pan tightly and store in the
fridge until needed (overnight preferably). Or you can make it and bake it
right away---delicious no matter what!

For the topping: Mix the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and some nutmeg in
a separate bowl. Stir together using a fork. Add the butter and use a pastry
cutter to mix it all together until the mixture resembles fine pebbles. Store
in a plastic bag in the fridge.

When you're ready to bake the casserole, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Remove the
casserole from the fridge and sprinkle the topping over the top. Bake for 45
minutes for a softer, more bread pudding texture or for 1 hour-plus or more for
a firmer, crisper texture.

This will smell amazing, and will probably wake people up.
