# Sushi Rice

This one is Hardy's, he wanted to figure out a way to make sushi for lunch every
day. This rice is the secret to being able to do that.

*instant pot, staple*

**2 Servings**

---

- *1 C* short grain brown rice
- *1 3/4 C* water
- *1 T* agave nectar
- *1 T* rice vinegar
- *3 dashes* salt

---

Dump it all into the cooker, stir, cook for 22 minutes, natural release.


> ![info](./images/info-icon.png) *If this comes out really a soupy mess, don't
worry, you may have gotten your measurements wrong, but it'll be fine. Just hit
the saut√© button, keep stirring the rice until the extra liquid boils off, about
10 minutes. Trust us, we've done this plenty, it'll work out.*

### NOTES

This rice will come out looking a tad too wet. Don't freak out, it's done, just
stir the rice a bit, and let it sit... it'll soak up that water.

Refrigerate this rice, and use as needed. Keeps up to 5 days.

Reheat cold sushi rice in the microwave for 45 seconds, you can add a splash of
rice vinegar after it has been reheated, if you want to spruce up the taste a
bit, but it's not necessary and we don't bother.

We've given the 2-roll recipe version, here are the measurements for scaling
this up.

| ingredient                   | 4 rolls | 6 rolls | 8 rolls |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| short grain brown rice       | 2 C     | 3 C     | 4 C     |
| water                        | 3 1/4 C | 4 3/4 C | 6 C     |
| agave nectar                 | 2 T     | 3 T     | 4 T     |
| rice vinegar                 | 2 T     | 3 T     | 4 T     |
| salt                         | 1/4 t   | 3/8 t   | 1/2 t   |

If you use *real* sushi rice, it's a white rice, so 1:1 ratio, cook for 5
minutes in the cooker, 10 minutes natural release. In the rice cooker, you just
hit the "white rice" button and let it do its thing. Remember 1:1 ratio of rice
to water, all other ingredients are the same. It works great!
