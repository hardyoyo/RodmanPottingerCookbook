### NOTES

This rice will come out looking a tad too wet. Don't freak out, it's done, just stir the rice a bit, and let it sit... it'll soak up that water.

Refrigerate this rice, and use as needed. Keeps up to 5 days. 

Reheat cold sushi rice in the microwave for 45 seconds, you can add a splash of rice vinegar after it has been reheated, if you want to spruce up the taste a bit, but it's not necessary and I don't bother.
