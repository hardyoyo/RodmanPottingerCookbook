> ![info](./images/info-icon.png) *If this comes out really a soupy mess, don't
worry, you may have gotten your measurements wrong, but it'll be fine. Just hit
the saut√© button, keep stirring the rice until the extra liquid boils off, about
10 minutes. Trust us, we've done this plenty, it'll work out.*

### NOTES

This rice will come out looking a tad too wet. Don't freak out, it's done, just
stir the rice a bit, and let it sit... it'll soak up that water.

Refrigerate this rice, and use as needed. Keeps up to 5 days.

Reheat cold sushi rice in the microwave for 45 seconds, you can add a splash of
rice vinegar after it has been reheated, if you want to spruce up the taste a
bit, but it's not necessary and we don't bother.

We've given the 2-roll recipe version, here are the measurements for scaling
this up.
