Rinse the black-eyed peas and throw out any grit or fucked up looking peas. Put
the peas in a medium container and cover them with a couple inches of water. Let
them soak overnight or for at least 6 hours. After they have soaked, drain the
peas and start fucking cooking.

Chop up the onion, bell peppers, and celery. In a large pot, warm up the olive
oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté that shit until it starts to
brown in some places, about 6-9ths  minutes. Add the bell peppers and celery and
cook until they get a little soft, about 3 minutes. Take the chipotle peppers
out of the can, cut them open and scrape out the seeds. These little bastards
can be spicy, so taking out the seeds helps you keep that heat wherever the fuck
you like it. If you prefer it hot then keep some of the seeds in.

Chop up the chipotles and dice up the garlic real fine. Add both to the pot and
stir all that shit up. Add the thyme, oregano, paprika, black pepper, bay
leaves, and salt and cook for 30 seconds. Toss in the drained black-eyed peas
and the broth and bring that shit to a simmer.

Let it simmer uncovered until the peas are tender. This can take anywhere from
30 minutes to an hour depending on how long you soaked your peas and how old
they are. If you start running out of broth before those are ready, add a little
more broth or water. If the peas are tender and you’ve still got too much broth
in there, just drain some of that shit off. Not a big fucking deal. Just check
the seasoning when you are all done and add more herbs or spices if you think it
needs it.

Serve this seasonal standard over your favorite kind of rice, topped with some
green onions, and with a side out sautéed collards, spinach, kale, or COCONUT
BRAISED COLLARD GREENS for extra luck or some superstitious shit like that. You
can add a vinegar based hot sauce (like Crystal or Tabasco) on that shit and
take it to another level.
