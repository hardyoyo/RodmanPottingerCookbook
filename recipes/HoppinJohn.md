Rinse the black-eyed peas and throw out any grit or weird looking peas. Put
the peas in a medium container and cover them with a couple inches of water. Let
them soak overnight or for at least 6 hours.

Chop the onion, bell peppers, carrot and celery. In a large pot, warm up the
olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it starts to
brown in some places, about 6 minutes. Add the bell peppers, carrot and celery.
Cook until they get a little soft, about 3 minutes. Add chipotle peppers and
garlic to the pot, stir. Add spices, bay leaves, and salt and cook for 30
seconds. Toss in the drained black-eyed peas and the broth and bring simmer.

Simmer uncovered until the peas are tender. This can take anywhere from
30 minutes to an hour depending on how long you soaked your peas and how old
they are. If you start running out of broth before those are ready, add a little
more broth or water. If the peas are tender and you’ve still got too much broth
in there, just drain some off. Not a big deal. Just check the seasoning when
you are all done and add more herbs or spices if you think it needs it.

a hurry, soup button, 7 minutes, quick release, or if you're using dry beans
(totally OK!), double the liquid to 6 cups, and cook for 26 minutes, natural
release.*
