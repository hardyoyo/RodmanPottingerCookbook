# Pasta in the Instant Pot

from: https://inquiringchef.com/how-to-cook-pasta-in-the-instant-pot/

*instant pot, pasta*

**4 Servings**

---

- *8 oz* Pasta, any type
- *2 C* water
- *1/2 t* salt

---

This recipe is specific to a 6 quart instant pot. Look at your box of pasta, and
find the time for the pasta to cook, then compare that time to the chart below,
to find your cook time for the instant pot. Combine the pasta water and salt in
the cooker, giving everything a stir. Close and lock the lid. Set the vent to
sealing. Set the time using the time you found in the chart below. Natural
release for **exactly 5 minutes**. If you let it sit any longer, your pasta will
over-cook and be a sticky mess. Release pressure and open the lid. Give the
pasta a good stir, about 20-30 times. If you're adding sauce, you can add it
now. Put the lid back on (no need to lock it), leave the pasta for 5-10 minutes
more. This is the most important part, your pasta is still cooking. After 5
minutes or so, the pasta is ready to eat. Enjoy!

* 0 is a real setting on the instant pot. For small pasta shapes with a short
recommended cook time, set the timer for zero minutes. The cooker will fully
pressurize but won't hold for any amount of time.

> ![info](./images/info-icon.png) **Spaghetti, Fettuccini or Linguini**: long
straight pasta shapes need to be treated differently than other pasta shapes.
Break the pasta strands in half. Add the pasta to the cooker, then add just
enough water to cover every strand. No set amount, just be sure every noodle is
covered with water. Add a couple shakes of salt. Do not stir. Pressure cook
according to the time on the chart. Natural release for 5 minutes, then release
any remaining pressure, stir the pasta well to loosen any strands of pasta stuck
together. Drain the pasta in a collander, as you would after a normal boiling
method.
