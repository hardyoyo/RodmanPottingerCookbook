# I'm Sick Soup

We came up with this one time when we really wanted something like chicken soup.
This is better.

*soup*

**8 Servings**

- *1* small leek (chopped)
- *1* medium onion (chopped)

If you're using tofu, cube it up and sauté it in a splash of vegetable oil and a
splash of soy sauce, in a medium skillet. When it's brown on most sides, proceed
with the soup.

In a large stock pot, add the olive oil. Sauté the leek, onion and garlic, 4-5
minutes. Dump in the celery, carrot, water, broth powder, soup mix (if you have
it), and chick peas. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 30
minutes. Add the noodles, basil, soy sauce and boil for 5-10 minutes, or until
the noodles are soft. Add the lemon juice and stir. Add the tofu if you're using
it. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let it cool for 5 minutes, then serve.

You *could* do this in an instant pot, but if so, try to just use the sauté
button and simmer the soup like you would on the stove. The smell of this soup
is part of the magic. You won't get nearly enough of that if you try to cook
this under pressure.
