Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9-in. pie dish with coconut oil. Add
pecans to food processor with the S blade, process until a fine crumb forms,
the size of sand. Add coconut oil, maple syrup, salt and oat flour and process
again until the dough comes together. Pulse in the rolled oats until the oats
are finely chopped, but still have some texture to them. The dough should stick
together when pressed between your fingers. If it doesn't, try processing for a
bit longer. With your fingers, crumble the dough evenly over the base of the pie
dish. Starting from the middle, press the mixture firmly and evenly into the
dish, moving outward and upward along the side of the pie dish. The harder you
press the crumbs into the dish, the more it will hold together. Poke 5-6 fork
holes into the bottom to let the air escape. Bake pie crust, uncovered, at 350°F
for 10-13 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant. Remove from oven and set
aside to cool on a rack for at least 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together
the milk with the arrowroot powder until smooth. In a large mixing bowl, whisk
together all the pumpkin filling ingredients, including the arrowroot and milk
mixture. If your pumpkin puree is firm and grainy, add this filling into a food
processor and whirl it until smooth. You might need to add a bit more milk if
the pumpkin was really dense. Pour the filling into the baked crust and smooth
smooth it out. Bake, uncovered, at 350°F for 37-45 minutes until the pie is
semi-firm, but still a bit soft. Watch the crust and cover with foil if
necessary. It should be nice and golden at around 40 minutes.
Cool the pie for 2 hours and then cover with foil and transfer
to the fridge to set overnight. Serve the pie straight from the fridge.
NOTE: to make the oat flour, add 1/2 C and 1/3 C of rolled oats into a blender.
Blend on high until a fine flour forms.
