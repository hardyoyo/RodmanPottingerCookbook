Saut√© the onion in olive oil until translucent (about 5 minutes), add rice,
toast the rice... it's done when it goes from clear to a bit brown at edges, and
smells nice and toasty. Add a swig of white cooking wine to deglaze (optional,
if you don't have wine, don't sweat it, you can deglaze with the water, which is
the exact next thing you're going to add).  Add broth/water, stir, close cooker,
cook for 7 minutes at high pressure. Open cooker with a fast release. Melt 1T of
butter, margarine or goat cheese. Add Parmesean cheese or nutritional yeast,
stir. Add nutmeg, stir again, and serve.
