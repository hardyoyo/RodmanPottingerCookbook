# Lentil Soup

This recipe is based loosely on Garlic Lover's Lentil Soup from _Great
Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure_ by Lorna Sass, the times are from the Instant
Pot cookbook that comes with the cooker. Lorna's recipe doesn't call for
celery, you can substitute lots more garlic if you don't have celery.
