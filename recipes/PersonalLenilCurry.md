powder. Find a medium ceramic bowl and the trivet for your Instant Pot. Put the
water and the lentils in the bowl, stir in the Better than Bouillion or broth
powder and salt, then add the sautéd veggies, sprinkle on the cilantro last, if
you have any. Don't fret if you dont... Just pop on the lid and set the cooker
on soup, adjust the time to 15 minutes. Let it natural release for 10 minutes.
Then eat!
