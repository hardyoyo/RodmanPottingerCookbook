# Not Refried Beans

Not refried, just blended until it will pass for refried beans. Tastes a
million times better than canned refried beans. Use however much beans you have.
You will usually make this after a meal of beans and rice, though you can 
always whip up a batch of beans just so you can make Not Refried Beans, nobody 
will judge you for it. The amounts of the other ingredients are a guess, just 
kinda eyeball it and go with your gut.

**5 Servings**

---

- *2-6 C* pinto or black beans
- *1 T* Braggs liquid aminos
- *2 t* cumin
- *1 t* roasted garlic powder (plain will do)
- *1/4 t* sesame oil (optional)

Dump everything in either a food processor (with an S blade) or a blender,
either works fine. You can even use an immersion blender, if you want, but
the beans will probably break it. Yep.

Oh, press the button and blend those beans! Store about half in the fridge in
an air-tight container. Freeze the other half for the future. About 2 cups of
these is the same as a can, so use whatever size freezer container you have,
but try to keep each container sized for the amount of beans you think you
can eat before they go bad.
