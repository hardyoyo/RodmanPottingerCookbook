# Gluten-free Field Roast Replacement

If you have favorite recipes that call for Field Roast, and a family member with
gluten sensitivity, this is a worthwhile endeavor.

*gluten alternative*

**5 Servings**

---

- *2 t* salt
- *1 t* sage
- *1 t* garlic powder
- *1 t* black pepper
- *1 1/2 T* brown sugar
- *1 1/2 t* liquid smoke
- *1 T* apple (grated)
- *1 C* apple juice
- *1* block of extra-firm tofu, pressed

---

Make the marinade ahead of time, it will keep in the fridge in a small jar for
weeks. This is a great thing to make if you have a family member who does not
always eat the apple you lovingly slice for their lunch box. Don't compost those
apples! Make Field Roast Replacement instead!

### Marinade

Mix everything except the tofu in a jar. Shake it up, park it in the fridge for
later. Keeps forever.

### Roast

When you're ready to make the roast, press some tofu, then chop into 1/2 in
cubes. Put in a medium container, and cover the tofu with marinade. Marinade for
at least 30 minutes, but like most marinades, longer is better. Days, even. Four
hours is good.

Your cooking options are multiple. A dehydrater works well but will take
forever. An air fryer is faster, but keep the heat low unless you *like* charred
food. Either way, your goal is to get the tofu to be as chewy as Field Roast.
Just check on it regularly. Try not to eat it all.

Freezes well, or refrigerate it if you're planning on using it soon.

Make some Wild Rice Pilaf!
