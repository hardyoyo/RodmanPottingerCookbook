Use pizza dough cycle, will be done in less than an hour.

### Pizza 

Preheat oven to 450°F, bake for 12-15 minutes

### Par-bake 

You can make just the crust, and freeze it for later. 350°F oven, 7-10 minutes,
until toasty (you want it to keep it's shape after it cools). Can freeze the
crust as-is, maybe on some wax paper so it doesn't stick to stuff, then put it
in a large ziplock or some other plastic container after it's frozen. Keeps a
couple months, but good luck ignoring a large pizza crust in your freezer for
that long.
