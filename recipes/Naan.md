*Indian, bread*

**6 Servings**

---

- *1 t* yeast
- *2 t* sugar
- *2 C* flour (gluten-free OK)
- *1 t* salt
- *1/8 t* baking powder
- *3 T* plain yogurt
- *2 T* olive oil

In a large glass, dissolve the yeast and 1 t of sugar with 3/4 C warm water. Let
it sit on your counter until it's frothy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the
flour, salt, remaining 1 t of sugar into a large deep bowl. Stir unitl all the
dry ingredients are well mixed. Once the yeast is frothly, add yogurt and olive
oil to the glass, and stir to combine. Pour this mixture into the flour mixture,
and gently mix it all with a fork. When the dough starts to come together, use
your hands to mix it. It will feel a bit goopy at first, but stick with it, it
will turn into a workable dough soon. Keep kneeding until it comes together and
seems like a solid hunk of dough. Cover it with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel,
let it sit for 2-4 hours. Get a bowl of water and a bowl of extra flour (about a
cup of each for each bowl). When the dough is done sitting, divide it into 6
equal portions, lightly roll each portion in the bowl of flour. This is to make
the dough ball workable, not quite so sticky. Shape the naan, using a rolling
pin. You're going for a teardrop shape, about 9 inches long and 4 inches wide at
the widest, and about 1/4 inch thick. If you're using gluten-free flour, skip
the rolling pin and just use your fingers. Warm a cast iron skillet on high
heat. Cook the naan in the skillet, about 1 minute on the first side (it'll get
bubbly, then flip. It'll be blistered and a bit blackened, but that's OK, it's
supposed to look like that, right? You can dust each finished naan with a bit of
butter and a sprinkle of salt, but only if you want to, they're fine without
anything else. Enjoy!
