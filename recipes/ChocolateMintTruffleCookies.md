# Chocolate Mint Truffle Cookies

*desert*

**60 Servings**

This is a holiday favorite. The mint truffle Hershey's Kisses are a seasonal
thing, you'll only see them around Christmas. Keep an eye out for their
appearance, and snag a few, so you can make a batch or two of these. They make
perfect gifts for neighbors or the mail man, so make a bunch, just try not to
eat them all at once.

Preheat oven o 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment
paper. In a bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. Set aside. Combine sugar, cream cheese and melted butter in a
large bowl and whisk until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Whisk in oil. Add
egg, milk, and vanilla exract and stir (with a wooden spoon, don't try to use
the whisk for this part, poor whisk) until smooth. Fold in flour mixture until
all the flour is incorporated and no dry ingredients remain. Dough will be soft,
but should still be workable. If not, refrigerate it for about 15-20 minutes
until it is. Use a medium cookie scoop to portion out about 2 T of dough. Press
a kiss in the center, shape into a ball around it. Arrange on prepared baking
sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie. Bake for 11-13
minutes, until cookies are set and cracked. Cool on the baking sheet for 3
minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight
container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
