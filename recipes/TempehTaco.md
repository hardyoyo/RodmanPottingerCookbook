*staple*

**5 Servings**

---

- *2* 8 oz. packages of Tempeh
- *1 T* Olive Oil
- *3 T* Tamari
- *1/4 C* Lime Juice
- *1 T* Chili Powder
- *1 T* Paprika or Chili Powder
- *1 t* Onion Powder

Crumble Tempeh in a mixing bowl with a fork. Combine Olive Oil, Tamari, Lime
Juice and all spices in a bowl, dump on the Tempeh, mix well. Let stand 10-30
minutes (or make ahead and park it in the fridge). When it's taco time, start a
large skillet on medium heat, sauté the onion until it's starting to turn brown
on the edges, add tempeh mixture, sauté briefly to heat the mixture, whenever it
starts sticking to the skillet, it's probably warm, turn it off and concentrate
on getting ready for the tacos: you'll want to chop tomatoes, avacado, and
whatever other fixings you want (lettuce? onion? cheese? definitely salsa).
Enjoy your tacos!

### HINT 

If you don't have time for marinading the tempeh, add a bit more lime juice,
and cook it up right away, it'll be fine!
