# Steamed or Boiled Potatoes

*instant pot, staple*

**5 Servings**

---

- *6-8* whole potatoes (red or yukon gold)
- *1 C* water
- *1/2 t* salt

DO NOT TRY TO USE THIS RECIPE WITH THE RICE COOKER. POTATOES ARE TOO BIG AND
DENSE TO STEAM EFFECTIVELY IN A RICE COOKER. YOU NEED A PRESSURE COOKER LIKE THE
INSTANT POT FOR THIS RECIPE.

Scrub/wash potatoes well, stab them a bit with a fork (you're making vent
holes). Add water to cooker, put potatoes in a steamer basket. Cook on
steam setting for 10 minutes. Natural release. Check tenderness with a fork, if
necessary, re-cook for 3-5 minutes. You've had potatoes before, you want these
to be cooked, not raw. That's what you're aiming for.

Cool the potatoes under running cold water, to stop the cooking, and to make
them easier to handle. Literal hot potatoes are difficult to hold.

Or you can chop them up a bit, saut√© with onions and cumin, and use the mixture in rolled tacos, or samosas. Or cube them up and fry them in a skillet with a splash of oil for breakfast burritos.*
