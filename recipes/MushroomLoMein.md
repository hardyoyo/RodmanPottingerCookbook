# Mushroom Lo Mein

This is the first recipe Hardy ever memorized, and taught to all of his friends.
It's a crowd pleaser, easy, and the ingredients are very commonly available in
almost any kitchen. It's not particularly nutritious, though, and full of fat.
So... best not to make this a habbit.

*easy, noodles*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 T* margarine or butter
- *2 t* garlic, minced
- *1* package of spaghetti or other thin noodle, gluten-free would be fine
- *1* package of button mushrooms
- *1 T* Tamari/soy sauce
- *1 T* sesame oil

---

Start a pot of water for the noodles. Rinse and slice the mushrooms thinly. In
a medium frying pan, melt the margarine or butter, and sauté the garlic, on
medium-low heat. Try to avoid burning the garlic, which means you'll have to
pay attention to this part. As soon as the garlic is translucent (maybe 30
seconds), add the mushrooms and sauté them as well. At some point the water for
the noodles will be ready, boil the noodles, but don't let the mushrooms burn.
As soon as the mushrooms are reduced and saucy-looking, mix in the sesame oil
and tamari or soy sauce, take them off the burner and set them aside. When the
noodles are done, drain them, then mix in the mushrooms. Toss the noodles and
mushrooms until the noodles seem evenly coated, then eat. Try to pair this dish
with some sort of green vegetable.
