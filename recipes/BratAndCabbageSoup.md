# Brat and Cabbage Soup

We sometimes jokingly call this "Roten Cabbage Soup" because it gets a laugh.
Not always.

*soup, instant pot*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 T* olive oil
- *1* package of veggie brats, cut into 1/2 in. slices
- *1* onion, diced
- *4-6* small potatoes, cut into 1/2 in chunks
- *1* small head of cabbage, chopped
- *10 C* water (approximately)
- *4 t* Better than Bouillon

---

Set the cooker to sauté, add oil, add brats, cook about 2 minutes. Add onion,
cook until translucent, and a little brown at the edges. Add water and bouillon,
add potatoes, add cabbage, put on the lid. Press the soup button, set for 10
minutes. Quick release and eat.

### Gluten-free alternative

Use a gluten-free meat substitute like Quorn (their Meatless Pieces are even
already chopped to the right size, easy/peasy).

If you're cooking for mixed company, you can sauté both brats and Quorn (in
separate skillets, obviously) and then invite your guests to add whatever meat
substitute they prefer to their soup.
