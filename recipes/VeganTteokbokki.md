If your TTeok are frozen and stuck together, add them into a large bowl with
cold water to separate them for about 5-10 minutes before using them.
Add water and kelp to your Instant Pot. Close the lid, cook for 3 minutes.
Remove the kelp pieces. Add chopped cabbage, carrots, and sliced onion into the
pot and bring to a boil. In a bowl, mix the sauce: gochujang (use more or less
depending on your level of spice preference), gochugaru, Tamari, agave nectar
(or maple syrup) and minced garlic. Mix until smooth. Add the TTeok and sauce
to the broth, and stir. If you're adding the puffed/dry tofu, do it now. Bring
to a boil. Add in half the green onions. Turn the heat down to a medium-low and
let it cook for around 15-20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. When
ready to serve, top with the rest of the green onions and sesame seeds
(optional). Leftover Tteokbokki is divine, it'll keep for a long time in the
fridge.

can find it, probably online. From a Korean market, it will be in a bottle that
looks like a ketchup bottle. It won't be quite the same, but it'll still taste
amazing.*
