Set the instant pot to sauté. Sauté the onion until it's just turning brown,
then add the ginger, stir, sauté for about 30 seconds more. Add the water and
tamari, and the Pho spices satchet. Pop on the lid, set the cooker for 7 
minutes. Start the rice noodles soaking (read the instructions on the package, 
but generally you soak them for 20-30 minutes, then you can add them to the 
soup when it's ready, but it's not ready yet). Now you work on the garnishes. 
If you're using dry mushrooms, soak them, too. Gather all the garnishes, 
putting them in bowls. Chop the herbs, and put them into a bowl. Slice the lime 
into small wedges and put them in a bowl. Slice the green onion and put in a 
bowl. Slice the jalepeno. You can make the carrots fancy by slicing 4-5 
"trenches" lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise as normal. This will give 
you crosses or stars, depending on how many trenches you sliced. This can be 
time-consuming, but, you're not in a hurry, you're waiting for the soup and 
noodles to be done. Oh, don't forget the mushrooms!

Thinly slice the mushrooms, then sauté them in a small frying pan, with a splash
of olive oil, and few dashes of salt. Cook until tender and lightly browned,
about 4-6 minutes, then set them aside.

Whenever the cooker beeps, open the lid and fish out the spice satchet. Taste 
the broth, and season it to taste, with salt, tamari and/or pepper. Ladle the 
broth into large soup bowls, add the noodles and mushrooms, let everyone garnish
their own soup from here on out.
