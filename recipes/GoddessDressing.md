You can mix this by hand if you want, but the result will be better in a
blender. Dump it all in, blend until smooth. You could also put it all in a
mason jar, stir it a bit with a spatula, then put a lid on tight, and shake the
heck out of the jar.

This is a nice quick gluten-free alternative salad dressing. If you don't have
any GF dressing on hand, this will do the job. You can also use it in a wrap.
Since it's fresh, it'll taste better than store-bought Goddess Dressing, and it
won't have any of the Gluten they insist on putting in it.
