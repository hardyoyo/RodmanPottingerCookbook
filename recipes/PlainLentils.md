*staple*

**2 Servings**

- *1 C* green or brown lentils
- water (enough to cover the lentils)

Lentils are the perfect snack and so easy to cook, this recipe feels a bit silly
to type up. But, here you go: dump a cup of lentils on whatever you're cooking
them in (an Instant Pot is fine, but so is a sauce pan on a stove, whatever you
have handy will work). Add enough water to cover the lentils, and maybe an inch
or two more. It's not precise, lentils are easy. If you're using an Instant Pot,
press the manual button and set the timer for 8 minutes, lock the lid, you'll be
eating in about 15 minutes or less. If you're cooking on the stove, put a lid on
the pot (optional, but quicker), boil, turn down the pot to a simmer,  and stir
the lentils occasionally so they don't stick. They'll be done in about 45
minutes or less.
