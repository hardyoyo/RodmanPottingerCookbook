**6 Servings**

- *8 oz.* spinach (about 2 handfulls)
- *1 t* garlic, minced

- *1.5 t* Tamari/GF soy sauce
- *1.5 t* toasted sesame oil

- *1 t* Korean red pepper flakes

You are also making Soybean Sprout Salad (see page
\pageref{soybean-sprout-salad}), right? If so, stack two colanders, with the
spinach in the first, then the second stacked on top of the spinach.  When you
drain the sprouts through the colander stack, you'll blanche the spinach. Rinse
with cold water until the spinach can be handled. Bunch it up in a ball and
squeeze the excess water out. Cut the spinach into bite-size chunks with
kitchen shears into a medium mixing bowl. Mix with the remaining ingredients.
