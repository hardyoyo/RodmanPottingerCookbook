# Basil, Brown Rice and Lentil Pilaf

Hardy made this one up, when a coworker gave him a massive amount of basil. It
used to be way more complex, until Debbie figured out we could cook the lentils
and the rice at the same time, in the same pot. It doesn't have to be vegan, if
you don't mind cheese, substitute parmesean cheese for nutritional yeast.

*instant pot, vegan, gluten-free*

This recipe can use up any excess of fresh basil you might have. Seriously, just
chop it up and add it in. All of it.

Set the cooker to sauté and sauté the onions until they turn brown a bit at the
edges, add the garlic and basil, sauté for 30 seconds more, then add the rice
and stir it around a bit, until it soaks up all the oil and starts to smell
toasty. Then add the water, Better than Bouilion, tomatoes and lentils. Pop on
the lid, set the cooker for 24 minutes, natural release (the rice will need the
extra time so it doesn't come out too hard). If the rice *is* crunchy, you can
put the lid back on, and run the cooker for 1 minute at pressure, and really
truly do a natural release. Cook a side dish or two if you need something to do
while you wait.

Resist the urge to add any other spices to this recipe. The basil is the star of
the show, let it shine.

After the natural release is done, stir in the nutritional yeast. If you're not
vegan, you can use parmesean cheese instead. Or both, both works.

ingredients from Walmart. They sell a can of cooked lentils, and they have brown
rice in a bag, canned tomatoes, and a tube of chopped basil, if you can't find
fresh basil. It's OK to skip the nutritional yeast if you're winging it on the
road. We made this on vacation in Halifax, NS, in a tiny apartment, and it was
really a nice treat.*
