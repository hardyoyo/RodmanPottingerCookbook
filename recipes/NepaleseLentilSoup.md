# Nepalese Lentil Soup (AKA Dal)

*Instant Pot, soup*

**5 Servings**

---

- *1 T* olive oil
- *1/4 t* sesame oil
- *1* onion, chopped
- *1 t* garlic, minced
- *2 C* vegetable broth
- *1* 15 oz can recipe ready tomatoes
- *1* 13 oz can of coconut milk
- *1 C* red lentils
- *2 t* ginger (minced)
- *1 t* ground cumin
- *2 t* curry powder
- *1 t* salt
- *1/4 t* ground cinnamon
- *1 t* lemon juice
- *1 C* fresh cilantro, chopped

---

Heat oils, add onion, saut√© until brown at edges, add garlic for 30 seconds, add
everything else, put on cooker lid, press the soup or manual button, set time
for 7 minutes. Natural pressure release is better, but you can do a quick
release if you want. Stir in lemon and cilantro, serve either as a soup, or over
rice.

### NOTES

- Almost any sort of recipe ready/diced tomatoes will work, but be careful, some
of the "fire roasted" options will include spices. "Salsa Style" *will* be spicy
hot. Which is fine, if that's what you want, but spicy Dal isn't everyone's cup
of tea.
