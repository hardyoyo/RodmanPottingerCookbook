# Flaky Old-Fashioned Biscuits

*breakfast*

**5 Servings**

---

- *3 C* flour
- *1 1/2 T* baking powder
- *1 T* sugar
- *3/4 t* cream of tartar
- *1/2 t* salt
- *1 1/2* sticks of butter
- *1 C* soy milk

Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Stir together dry stuff. Chop up the butter into small
chunks, cut in with a wire pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Make a well in the flour/butter mixture. Dump milk in the well. Stir
with a wooden spoon until the dough clings together. Knead the dough on a
lightly-floured surface (a large cutting board is ideal, but you can use the
counter, if it's clean). Pat the dough until it's roughly 1/2 in. thick. Cut
biscuit shapes with a biscuit cutter. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Stick around, you
do *not* want to burn biscuits, and they *will* if you leave them for much 
longer than 12 minutes.

* If you don't have a biscuit cutter, you can make one
out of a small jar lid from your recycling bin (clean it first). Grandmum used
to always use an old tomato paste can. Or you can buy a biscuit cutter.
* If the butter needs softening, 10 seconds on power level 2 in the microwave 
will do the trick. Take it out of the wrapper first, so it doesn't explode. And 
you might as well cut it into chunks. Try not to melt the butter completely, but 
don't worry if you do. Your biscuits will taste fine either way.
