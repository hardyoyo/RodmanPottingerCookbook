# Soy Curls Fajita Filling

[Butler Soy Curls](https://www.butlerfoods.com/soycurls.html) are an Oregon
thing, but you can order them online. They keep forever and are easy to handle.
You should have some in your pantry, and probably in your prepper box, too.
This fajita filling is also perfect for burritos.

**5 Servings**

---

- *1* 8oz. bag of Butler Soy Curls
- water for soaking
- *1 t* Better than Bouillon
- *1 t* Braggs liquid aminos
- *2-3* drops of sesame oil
- *1* small onion, sliced (optional)
- *1-2* bell peppers, different colors are cool, sliced (optional)
- *1 T* salsa, any kind
- *1 T* lime juice
- *1/4 t* liquid smoke or smoked paprika
---

Put it all into a medium bowl. Let the Soy Curls soak for about 10 minutes.
Drain the liquid (you can save it for making fajita sauce if you want, see
below). Squish the Soy Curls in your hands to squeeze out more of the remaining
liquid (or don't, if you prefer very wet Soy Curls). You can sauté them up
plain, if you're in a hurry or feeling lazy. Or get fancy with onions and bell
peppers (the best option). You can make a quick fajita sauce with 1 C leftover
liquid from soaking the Soy Curls, salsa, lime juice and liquid smoke. Put half
the sauce in while you're sautéing the soy curls and friends, and add the
remaining half closer to the end of your sautéing.
