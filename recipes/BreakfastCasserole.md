While this seems like it would take a while to cook, it's the perfect thing to
make if you're already puttering in the kitchen anyway. Most of the time is
waiting, so... you can stack this with other things.

*crowd pleaser, brunch*

**12 Servings**

---

- *1* 20 oz bag of frozen hashbrowns
- *10* eggs
- *1/2 C* milk (optional, if you skip, add 2 more eggs)
- *1* bell pepper, diced (or any sort of colorful pepper you might have)
- *1* small onion, diced
- *2 t* garlic, minced
- *1 C* colby jack cheese, shredded
- *1 C* mozzarella cheese, shredded
- *1 t* salt
- *1/8 t* pepper
- *1/8 t* paprika
- *2 T* olive oil

Preheat oven to 450°F. Grease a 9x13 in baking dish. Pour hashbrowns into the
baking dish and press into an even layer. Evenly drizzle with olive oil and
sprinkle with salt. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until edges are just
starting to turn brown. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Reduce heat of
oven to 350°F. In a small skillet, sauté the onion until the edges start to
brown, add the peppers and garlic, sauté about a minute more. Add the salt,
paprika and pepper to the veggies. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together milk,
eggs, and the veggie mix from the skillet. Sprinkle half of the cheeses on top
of the hashbrowns. Pour the egg mixture over the top. Sprinkle with remaining
cheeses. Bake another 35 minutes until the center of the casserole is set in the
middle and the edges are bubbling. If it seems like it might need a bit more
time, turn off the oven and let it sit in the cooling oven for about 5 more
minutes. Take it out and let it cool for 5 more minutes, then serve and eat!
