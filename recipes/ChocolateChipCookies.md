In a mixing bowl beat the shortening and margarine or butter with an electric
mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add about half the flour, the
brown sugar, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and baking soda. Beat mixture until
thoroughly combined. Beat in the remaining flour. Stir in chocolate chips. Scoop
the dough into a teaspoon (or small cookie scooper) and transfer the glob onto
an ungreaseid cookie sheet. Don't smash it, just leave it and make some more
globs. Bake in a 375Â°F oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until edges are firm, but
don't let them turn too brown. Cool cookies on newspaper.
