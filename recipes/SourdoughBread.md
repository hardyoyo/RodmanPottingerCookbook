Everything goes in to the bread machine basket, run the dough cycle. When the
cycle is done, let the dough rise an hour (it can handle an extra hour of rising
if you can't get to it right away). Take the dough out to a lightly floured work
surface, split into two dough balls, roll each out flat-ish with your hands, or
use a roller if you want. Roll up the flat dough into a long tube jelly-roll
style. Tuck each end under the roll. Set in a French bread baking tray. Cover
with a kitchen towel. Briefly warm the oven to its lowest setting (it will
probably say "warm"), then turn the oven off. Pop the rising/covered dough in
the oven for an hour. The loaves should double in size. When ready to bake,
slice the top of each loaf lengthwise with a very sharp knife (you probably
don't use the carving knife much, it'll be sharp enough). Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
Bake loaves for about 20 minutes. Optionally, you can put an oven-safe baking
dish on the bottom shelf of the oven, with a couple of ice cubes in the dish,
when you put the loaves in to bake. This will make the bread a little more
crusty than normal, which can be fun.
