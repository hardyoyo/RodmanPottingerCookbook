from: Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker by Robin Robertson

**30 Servings**

---

- *1 32oz bag* whole raw almonds
- *3/8 C* Tamari/Gluen-free Soy Sauce
- *3 T* Sesame Oil
- *1/2 t* Cayenne Pepper (optional but awesome)

Dump almonds in the cooker bowl, turn it on, set it to high. Dump in the Tamari
and Sesame Oil, stir until it's all mixed. Cook for 15 minutes uncovered,
stirring occasionally, then 15 more minues covered, then 2.5 hours on low heat. 
Stir whenever you think of it--no pressure, you're mainly trying to keep the
sauce covering even on all the almonds. They'll char a bit, that's OK. So will
the cooker bowl, but it's ceramic and cleans easily with a long soak of water.
Store in airtight containers, these keep for a month or more, but these will be
gone in just a few days. You might portion them out into smaller containers if
you have them, to help with self control.
