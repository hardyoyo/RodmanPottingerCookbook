**6 Servings**

- *1* 8oz. package of Tempeh
- *1 T* tamari
- *1 T* olive oil
- *1 T* maple syrup
- *1/2 t* paprika
- *1/2 t* liquid smoke
- *1/2 t* cumin
- *1/2 C* water

Mix everything except the tempeh in a small bowl or a glass jar. Slice the
tempeh as thin as you can, as long as it doesn't fall apart. Soak the tempeh
strips in the marinade for 2 minutes, or you can store them in the fridge in the
mariade for later use (this is super convenient, and means you can make Tempeh
Bacon whenever you want). Cook in a splash of olive oil in a hot skillet, takes 
about 1-2 minutes per side, until both sides are golden brown and crisp. Add
salt and pepper to taste (probably won't need any).
