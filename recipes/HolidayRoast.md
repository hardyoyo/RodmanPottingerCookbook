This gluten-free and vegan alternative to Tofurkey is tasty, and worth making if
you're craving Tofurkey, but can't eat it--or if you *can* eat gluten, but you
can't find it in the store.

Press the tofu in a tofu press for about 30 minutes, use this time to gather
your remaining ingredients, and make the baste if you want to get fancier than
just balsamic vinegar. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a 4x8 in bread loaf
pan with parchment paper. Whenever you're ready, put the tofu in a food processor
with the S blade (or a blender if you don't have a food processor). Add
everything else except the chickpea flour and the vinegar. Blend a full minute,
pausing about half way to scrape down the sides with a spatula (just remember,
the S blade is sharp, so try not to ruin your spatula). Once the wet mixture has
fully combined, add the chickpea flour to the mix and process for about 45-60
seconds, until a thick and uniform mixture forms. Transfer the mixture to the
bread loaf paan. Press the mixture into the pan until it fills it completely and
evenly. It doesn't have to be perfectly smooth, but you don't want huge lumps.
Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the bread pan and reduce the temperature of the oven
to 350°F. Flip the pan onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and dump out the
tofu. Use a pastry brush to lightly cover the top and sides with your baste.
Return the tofu to the oven and bake an additional 30-35 minutes until the
exterior has browned and the tofu feels firm to the touch. Remove from oven when
you think it's ready, and let it sit for at least 5 minutes to set before
slicing.
