SautÃ© the onion until the edges start to brown, add the garlic for 30 more
seconds, add the spices. Add the sweet potatoes and tomato paste, stir, deglaze
the onion mixture by adding water and better than bouillon or broth powder,
add cans of tomatoes. Close lid and cook with the soup button for 8 minutes.
When done, blend with an immersion blender until the soup is very smooth, no
chunks of sweet potato left. Careful, it'll be hot and want to splash a bit.
