Eh, most of these ingredients are optional, use what you have, and feel free to
improvise. Dice/chop everything that needs chopping, hit the sauté button on the
cooker, sauté the onion, cellery and carrot. When the onion looks like it's
getting a bit brown, add in whatever else you're adding (peppers, chillies,
mushrooms) and sauté a bit more until it all smells good, add the spices, add
the tomatoes, add the beans, add the TVP. Pop on a lid, hit the chilli button,
set the time for 3 minutes. Natural release. Maybe make some corn bread while
you wait.
