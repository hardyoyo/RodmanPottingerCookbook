Bring a large pot of water to a boil, cook noodles according to the directions
on the package (usually about 10 minutes). Drain and rinse the noodles in cool
water. Add 1t sesame oil to coat the noodles, then use scissors to cut the
noodles (around 3-4 times). In the same pot, add the spinach and blanch for 30
seconds. Rinse with cold water and squeeze excess liquid out using a towel.
Chop the bundled up spinach in half. Slice all the vegetables into match stick
sized pieces (or as close as you can get, bigger is OK, as long as they are
roughly the same size). Cut the tofu in to thin recangles. Put the Tamari,
water, and sesame oil in a small bowl and  stir. In a large skillet or wok,
over medium heat, fry the tofu with a splash of sesame oil until lightly
browned on each side. Transfer to another bowl and set aside. In the same
skillet/wok, fry the onions and garlic for 1 minute. Then add in the mushrooms
and carrot, fry for a minute. Add in the zucchini and scallions, fry for
another minute. Turn down the heat a bit, add in the noodles, spinach, tofu and
sauce. Toss and cook until the sauce is all soaked up. Serve and garnish with
sesame seeds.

> ![info](./images/info-icon.png) *Use 2 colanders to "blanch" the spinach in
"easy mode": put your spinach in a large colander, then put a smaller colander
on top, and put your colander stack in the sink. Drain your noodles in the
stacked colanders, and your spinach will be perfectly blanched by the boiling
water. You might think you only have one colander, but you can always improvise
something to make this idea work. Even if you have to use a coffee filter for
the top colander.*
