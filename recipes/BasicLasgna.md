*dinner*

**8 Servings**

---

- *1* 16oz. package of lasagna noodles (you'll have extra, that's OK)
- *1* egg
- *2 C* cottage cheese
- *1/2 t* Nutmeg
- *1/2 t* roasted garlic powder

- *1/2 C* Parmesan or Romano cheese, shredded (split)
- *1* 24 oz. jar of pasta sauce, we usually go with Classico Tomato & Basil
- *4 C* shredded mozzarella cheese

---

Start a stock pot full of cold water to boil for the noodles. Beat the egg in a
medium mixing bowl, then add the cottage cheese, spices, and 1/4 C Parmesan
cheese (save the other 1/4 C for topping the lasagna). Water for the noodles
should be boiling, so cook the noodles according to the directions on the
package. Drain the noodles in a pasta strainer, and run some cold water over
them so they're easier to handle (hot noodles suck). Preheat the oven to 375°F.
To assemble the lasagna, start with a bit of the sauce on the bottom of a
9 x 13 glass casserole dish. Put 3 noodles lengthwise on top of the sauce in
the bottom of the casserole dish. Spread with half of the cheese filling.
Then about half of the remaining pasta sauce. Then about 1C of the shredded
cheese. Repeat layers (alternate the way you lay the noodles in, to give the
lasagna a bit of structure, or don't if you don't care about such things, does
not really matter). Sprinkle the remaining cheese (mozzarellla and parmesan) on
top. Cover with foil and bake in a 375°F oven for 30 minutes. Uncover, bake for
5-10 minutes more, until the cheese on top is melty and golden. Remove from oven
and let it cool for about 10 minutes.

### To make ahead
