Put the olive oil, carrot, onion, ginger, garlic and salt in a large saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid sticking or burning, until
the onion is soft and transluscent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spices and
cook for another minute. Add water and cabbage and stir well to combine. Cover
and cook for 10 minutes. Add the peppers, cover, and cook until the cabbage is
very tender and the carrots are soft, about 5 minutes longer. Season to taste
with salt and pepper.
