start to brown, 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and spices (except the cilantro), and
sauté for another minute. Add chickpeas (including liquid from the can), bring

### CURRY SEASONING NOTE

What we call Curry Powder is really a spice blend, usually of three spices:
tumeric, cumin and coriander... with maybe some other additions like garam
masala. This recipe aims for a very specific taste, so you'll be mixing those
spices, to get the curry just right. Remember this recipe, if you have a recipe
that calls for curry powder, you can just make your own.
