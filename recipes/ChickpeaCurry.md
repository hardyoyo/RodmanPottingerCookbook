# Chickpea Curry

adapted from The Modern Ayurvedic Cookbook, by Amrita Sondhi

*Indian, Curry*

**6 Servings**

---

- *1 can* Chickpeas (or more, fill the skillet!)
- *2 T* olive oil
- *1 small* onion, minced
- *1 T* ginger, minced
- *1/4 t* tumeric
- *1/2 t* cumin
- *1/2 t* coriander
- *1/2 t* garam masala
- *1/4 t* cayenne pepper, or to taste
- *1 t* lemon juice
- *1* 8oz can of tomato sauce
- *1/4 C* cilantro leaves, chopped

---

In a large skillet on medium, heat the oil. Add onions and sauté until they
start to brown, 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and spices (except the cilantro), and
sauté for another minute. Add chickpeas (including liquid from the can) and
tomato sauce, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer about
20 minutes. When chickpeas are tender but not mushy, add lemon juice and adjust
for salt. Garnish with cilantro and serve.

### CURRY SEASONING NOTE

What we call Curry Powder is really a spice blend, usually of three spices:
tumeric, cumin and coriander... with maybe some other additions like garam
masala. This recipe aims for a very specific taste, so you'll be mixing those
spices, to get the curry just right. Remember this recipe, if you have a recipe
that calls for curry powder, you can just make your own.
