Preheat oven to 375°F. Press the tofu in a tofu press for about 30 minutes or
longer. If you don't have a tofu press, use two plates with something to weigh
down the top plate. After 30 minutes, drain off the water, and slice the tofu
into 1/2 inch cubes. Set them aside for later in a bowl. Steam and cool the
potatoes (instant pot works great for this), cut them up into 1/2 inch cubes,
put them in a large mixing bowl. Heat the vegetable oil and soy sauce/Tamari in
a large skillet (medium heat). Add the diced tofu. Cook until the tofu is
lightly golden on most sides. Add tofu to the mixing bowl with potatoes. In the
same skillet, heat olive oil, add the thin onion slices and garlic, sauté until
the onion is lightly browned, stir in chilies and spices, sprinkle flour, add
milk, stir and simmer until thickened. Add this mixture to the large bowl with
tofu and potatoes, mix it all thoroughly. Dump the mixture into a shallow glass
baking dish. Sprinkle the top with cheese. Bake 15 minutes.
