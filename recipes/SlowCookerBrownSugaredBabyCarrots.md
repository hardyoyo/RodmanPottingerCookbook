# Slow-Cooker Brown-Sugared Baby Carrots

*slow-cooker*

**10 Servings**

---

- *1* 32oz. bag of baby carrots
- *1/2 t* salt
- *1/2 C* brown sugar
- *2 T* butter, cut into small pieces
- *1 T* parsley, chopped, fresh, optional

---

Spray a large slow cooker with cooking spray. Add carrots, sprinkle with salt,
brown sugar and butter. Cover, cook on high for 4-5 hours, stiring after 2
hours. It's done whenever the carrots are at the tenderness you desire. You can
serve from a serving dish, if you want, but usually you'll have this parked on a
buffet with all the other slow cookers, so, no need for fancy. Remember to bring
a spoon, and don't forget to bring it back home!
