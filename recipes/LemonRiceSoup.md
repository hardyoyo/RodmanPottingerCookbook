Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the
onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until soft and translucent, five minutes.
Add garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook until fragrant, one to two minutes.

Stir in the zucchini, rice, and bay leaves until well incorporated, about one
more minute. Add the vegetable broth and water and bring the mixture to a boil.

Reduce heat to a low simmer and cook covered until rice is fluffy and
vegetables are soft, 30 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in as much of the lemon juice as youâ€™d like. Garnish
with chopped parsley and lemon slices, if desired. Serve immediately.
