Dressing: in a pint jar, add olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, agave,
salt and pepper. Screw on a lid tight, then shake the heck out of it to mix it
all up, and emulsify the ingredients. Salad: remove the kale stems. After all
the kale is stemmed, use a sharp knife to finely chop the kale. Dump all the
kale in a big bowl, drizzle the kale with some olive oil, you don't need a ton,
because you're adding a dressing. Sprinkle with some salt and massage the kale
with your clean fingers unil the kale softens a bit. Drizzle the dressing over
the kale and toss well. Add the almonds and dried fruit. Toss again and serve,
with a shake-jar of parmesean cheese at hand, for any non-vegans.
