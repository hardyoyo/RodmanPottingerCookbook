Drain the cans of jackfruit in a collandr, set aside. In a bowl add the garlic, 
onion, ketchup, oil, molasses, sugar, rice vinegar, spices, salt and pepper. 
Stir until it's a sauce. Place the drained jackfruit and the sauce in a
crockpot, making sure to gently coat all the jackfruit in the sauce evenly. Set
the crockpot to high for an hour, put the lid on. After an hour, carefully
remove the lid, it'll gas-off from the vinegar, so try not to breathe that in.
Using two forks, or a potato masher, gently shred the jackfruit in the sauce.
Put the lid back on, set the crockpot to low, let it cook at least 30 minutes
more, but you can leave it longer. When you're ready to eat, serve this with
some kind of bread (toast it so it doesn't fall apart). If you have the coleslaw
and are so inclined, top the jackfruit you've put on your bread with a dollop of
coleslaw. It's a southern thing, you don't have to do it. But it's yummy. Cap it
off with another piece of bread, and chow down.
