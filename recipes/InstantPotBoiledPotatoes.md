# Steamed or Boiled Potatoes

*instant pot, staple*

**5 Servings**

---

- *6-8* whole potatoes (red or yukon gold)
- *1 C* water
- *1/2 t* salt

---

Scrub/wash potatoes well, stab them a bit with a fork (you're making vent
holes). Add water to cooker, put potatoes in a steamer basket. Cook on
steam setting for 10 minutes. Natural release. Check tenderness with a fork, if
necessary, re-cook for 3-5 minutes. You've had potatoes before, you want these
to be cooked, not raw. That's what you're aiming for.

Cool the potatoes under running cold water, to stop the cooking, and to make
them easier to handle. Literal hot potatoes are difficult to hold.

## NOTE ##

Boiled potatoes are fantastic things to have on hand. You can eat them with just
a bit of salt, or get really fancy with salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese. Or
you can chop them up a bit, saut√© with onions and cumin, and use the mixture in
rolled tacos, or samosas.
