Heads up, this recipe takes about 2 hours, plan on making it ahead of when you
need this dough. It keeps pretty well in the fridge or freezer.

Whisk together dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Combine wet ingredients
in a small mixing bowl. Mix the wet and dry with a large wooden spoon. Cover the
dough (not air-tight, a clean dish towel will do). Let the dough rise for about
2 hours. Can be used right after the rise, but it's easier to handle if it's
cold, so store it in the fridge until you need it. Will keep for 5 days in the
fridge, or for 2 weeks in the freezer (thaw well before using it, of course).
When storing it in the fridge, do not use an airtight container, leave the lid
cracked a bit, or cover it with a clean kitchen towel. If you double this
recipe, split the resulting dough into 1/2-pound balls, before storing or
using.

If you want to make this recipe Vegan, you can substitute 2 "vegan eggs"
for the egg whites: 2T flaxseed in 5 T water, let it sit 5 minutes before using.

Resist the urge to use a lot of sauce on your GF pizza, even if the sauce is
nice and thick. GF dough is pretty wet in the first place, and using lots of
sauce will make it difficult to get a crisp crust.

If you have a pizza pan with lots of holes in it (the kind designed for frozen
pizza) that's the best choice for this dough. It will come out perfectly crispy.

From our experience, topping your GF pizza should be pretty spare: a few veggies
and a drizzle of sauce on top of them, after the pizza is cooked, will work out
best. Try a drizzle of Quick-Soaked Cashew Cheese Alternative (see page
\pageref{cheese-alternative}). Or just Olive Oil and Sea Salt.
