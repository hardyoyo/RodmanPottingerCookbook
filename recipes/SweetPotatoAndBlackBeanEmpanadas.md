In a small bowl, whisk together the flaxseed and 1/4 C of water and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Using a pastry cutter
or 2 forks, cut the butter into the flour mixture until the butter is in
pea-size chunks. To the soaked flaxseed mixture, add 1/3 C plus 1 T of ice
water and the vinegar. Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the flour, and
stir until the dough holds together when you pinch it between your fingers.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough while you prepare the
fillings. (Or, if you're prepping ahead of time, refrigerate the dough
overnight.) Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment
paper. Set aside. Prepare the sweet potato and black bean filling, or pull
leftovers out of the fridge to use as filling (lentil soup works great). Divide
the dough into 15 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 3-inch
round, approximately 1/4 in. thick, working with one piece at a time, and
keeping the rest of the dough balls covered so they don't dry out. Place
approximately 2T of filling in the middle of each dough round, positioning it a
tad closer to one side. Wet the edges of the dough with water, gently fold the
dough over, and press together to seal. Press with the tines of a fork around
the edge of the sealed dough, and transfer the empanadas to the prepared baking
sheets, spacing them at least 1 in. apart. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until
the tops are golden brown.
