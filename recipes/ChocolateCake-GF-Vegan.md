Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Position rack in center of oven. Grease two 8-inch round
cake pans (optional, one single rectangular cake pan is fine, too), set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt until there are no visible clumps. Add eggs, milk, oil and
vanilla. Beat with a mixer on medium speed for two minutes. Stir in boiling
water. Spoon batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for 35 to 38 minutes, or until
a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let
cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove from the pan and let cool on a rack. 
For the frosting (this cake doesn't really need frosting, but some people like
frosted cakes): in a medium mixing bowl, beat butter and vanilla until smooth
and creamy. Add cocoa powder and beat until combined. Gradually add powdered
sugar, one cup at a time. Slowly beat in milk. Beat in additional milk if
needed, to obtain desired consistency. Frost cakes. Stack them if you want, or
have two cakes. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3
days, or in the fridge for up to a week.

NOTES: 1) Flour Blend: Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 GF Baking Flour is a good choice.
Avoid Bob's Red Mill All Purpose GF Flour, because this blend has chickpea flour
in it. Chickpea flour goes rancid quickly, and when it does it creates a dry and
sour/bitter flavor. It also does something funny to this recipe. 2) When working
with any sort of flour, don't scoop out the flour with the measuring cup;
instead, spoon it out with a spoon into the measuring cup. If you scoop with the
measuring cup, you'll compact the flour, and get too much, and you'll have
regrets about too much flour.
