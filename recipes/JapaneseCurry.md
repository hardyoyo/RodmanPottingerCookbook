Start the tofu in a press or between two plates. you'll cube it later. Set the
cooker on sauté, wait until it's hot, add oil and sauté the onion until
it's translucent and a bit brown on the edges. Add garlic and ginger, sauté for
30 seconds more. Add the spices, stir, cook for about a minute longer. At this
point, you'll probably be chopping veggies, so add about a cup of water to the
cooker so you don't scorch the onions or the spices. Add the carrots, potatoes,
pepper, coconut milk, bouilion, agave syrup and Tamari, top up with a bit of
water until there is enough liquid to cover the veggies (though probably not
necessary if you added water during the sauté). Close the lid, set the cooker
for 5 minutes on manual. While the curry is cooking, cube the tofu, and start
a skillet on medium heat. Spray the skillet with some oil, then add 1T of curry
powder and 1t of paprika and 1t of cumin, and 1t of turmeric. Stir to mix the
spices, then toss in the tofu, and stir until the cubes are coated. Cook a bit
more, but you're not looking to brown them, just warm them a bit, then turn off
the skillet and wait for the cooker to finish. When it's done, do a quick
release. Hit the cancel button and then turn on sauté again, stir in the can
of tomatoes, and the tofu,cook for about 10 minutes more. Dissolve the
cornstarch (or tapioca starch) in a bit of water in a small bowl,then add the
cornstarch mixture to the curry. Stir well, and cook a few minutes more, until
the sauce has thickened. If it's still looking too thin, repeat the cornstarch
steps. If it's looking too thick, add a bit of water. Taste, adjust spices
to suit your desire (maybe just salt and pepper, but you can go with
cayenne pepper if you want hot curry, we recommend about 1/2 t of Cayenne
pepper to hit the right notes of off-the-shelf Japanese Curry cubes). If you
know you want hot curry sauce, add the Cayenne pepper with the other spices.
But we recommend tasting and adjusting the heat until you hit the right mark
you are aiming for. Serve with rice (brown or white, you pick) and a side salad.
