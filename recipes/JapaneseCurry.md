Set the cooker on sauté, wait until it's hot, add oil and sauté the onion until
it's translucent and a bit brown on the edges. Add garlic and ginger, sauté for
30 seconds more. Add the spices, stir, cook for about a minute longer. Add the
carrots, potatoes, pepper, coconut milk, bouilion, agave syrup and Tamari, top
up with a bit of water until there is enough liquid to cover the veggies. Close
the lid, set the cooker for 5 minutes on manual. Do a quick release. Hit the
cancel button and then turn on sauté again, stir in the can of tomatoes, and
cook for about 10 minutes more. Dissolve the cornstarch in a bit of water in a
small bowl, then add the cornstarch mixture to the curry. Stir well, and cook a
few minutes more, until the sauce has thickened. If it's still looking too thin,
repeat the cornstarch steps. If it's looking too thick, add a bit of water.
Taste, adjust spices to suit your desire (maybe just salt and pepper, but you
can go with cayenne pepper if you want hot curry). Serve with rice (brown or
white, you pick) and a side salad.
