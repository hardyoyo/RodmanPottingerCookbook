*Ethiopian, greens*

**8 Servings**

---

- *1/3 C* ground flaxseeds
- *1 C* water
- *2 T* olive oil
- *1/2* onion, minced
- *1/2 t* dried basil
- *1/2 t* salt
- *3 t* garlic, minced
- *1 t* ginger, minced
- *2* bunches of collard greens, ribbed and chopped
- *1/2* jalepeño pepper, sliced into thin rounds (optional)
- salt and pepper to taste

---

Optionally toast the ground flaxseeds in a small skillet for a minute or so.
Then add them to a small bowl with 3/4 C of water, stir well, let rest while the
onion cooks.

In a large pot, sauté the onion with olive oil, basil and salt. Cook over medium
heat, stirring frequently, until very soft and golden brown, about 10-12
minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, cook, stirring frequently to keep the ginger
from burning, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to high, add in the greens and
the remaining 1/4 C of water. Stir constantly, from teh bottom to the top,
incorporating the onion mixture with the greens. Once the greens have wilted
dramatically, after 1-2 minutes, reduce heat to medium. Give the flaxseed
mixture one last stir, and add it to the greens, and stir well to combine. Cover
and cook, stirring frequently, until the greens are quite tender, about 10
minutes. Add up to 1/4 C more water, as needed, if the greens are becoming dry.
Add the pepper (if you're using it), simmer uncovered until the sauce has
thickened and the greens are very tender, about 5 minutes longer. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

Try to finish this dish up in a day or so, it doesn't keep well in the fridge.
