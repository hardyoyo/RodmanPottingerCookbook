# Personal Oatmeal in the Instant Pot
*instant pot, breakfast*

**1 Servings**

---

- *1/3 C* rolled oats
- *2/3 C* water for the oats
- *2 C* water for the cooker

---

This is a single-serving recipe, but you can make as many servings as you can
find mugs to fit in the instant pot. So far, the most we've made in one go is 3
mugs. If you find exactly the right size/shape mug (triangles would be perfect)
you could make 4.

Prepare the cooker: 2 cups of water in the pot, add a steamer basket or the
rack. Find a ceramic bowl, or mugs if you're making more than one serving. Add
oats and water to the bowl or mug, set the bowl on top of the rack or basket
inside the cooker. Set cook time from the table below, using the porridge button
and the plus/minus buttons to adjust the time.
