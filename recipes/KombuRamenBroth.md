### Make Broth

add all ingredients, bring to boil, simmer for 20 minutes

### Make Ramen Base

Sauté 1 chopped onion in 1 T olive oil, add a drop of sesame oil if you want.
When onion is turning brown at the edges, add 1T of garlic and 1T of ginger.
Sauté about 30 seconds more, add broth, simmer.

### Ramen!

Boil noodles (steal some from a boring package of noodles, or find some
specialty freeze-dried noodles if you want a treat; Amazon has them, probably a
local asian food market does, too), combine with Ramen base, garnish with fun
Ramen garnishes (shredded carrot, sautéd shitake mushrooms, sliced boiled
egg, cubed baked tofu, frozen peas.
