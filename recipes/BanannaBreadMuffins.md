baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the mashed bananna, shortening, and
non-dairy milk. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until blended, then on
high speed for 2 minutes. Add vegan eggs and remaning flour, beat until blended.
Stir in chocolate chips. Put paper liners into 2 muffin trays. Use a cookie
scoop to drop 2 dollops of dough for each muffin. Bake in a 350Â°F oven for 22
minutes or till a toothpic inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool
for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Remove from the pan and cool thoroughly on a
wire rack.

This is a double recipe, adapted for muffins. If you want to make a single loaf
