*condiment*

**20 Servings**

---

- *1* medium red onion
- *1/4 C* distilled white vinegar
- *1 t* salt
- *1 t* Agave syrup
- *5* whole black peppercorns
- *1* pint mason jar
---

Gather all ingredients. Thinly slice red onion. Pack onion slices into a clean 1
pint mason jar. Combine vinegar, salt, sugar and peppercorns in a small pan,
bring to boil over medium heat. Carefully pour brine solution over onions
(probably do this in the sink, so splashes aren't a big deal). Let stand,
uncovered, for 30 minutes. Seal the jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake well.
Refrigerate until flavor develops, at least one hour or up to two weeks, before
serving. Keep refrigerated. Will keep as long as normal pickles (many months) as
long as you keep them refrigerated. Use these as garnish on tacos, pizzas,
salads, or soup.
