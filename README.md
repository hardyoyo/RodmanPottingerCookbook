# Rodman/Pottinger Cookbook Project

This is a collection of recipes we use on a regular basis, and will hopefully be
used to produce a family cookbook, if I keep my act together this year.


## Software/Specs Used

* [RecipeMD](https://recipemd.org/): for the excellent makrdown recipe format, and a few nice [tools](https://recipemd.org/recommended_tools.html).
* [Cookie](https://github.com/bbugyi200/cookie): for quickly creating a new recipe
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): for converting recipes into PDF files
* [poppler-utilsa](https://packages.debian.org/sid/poppler-utils): for it's
handy pdf-unite tool, so I can slap the coverpage on the final PDF of the
cookbook.
* [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/): for general typesetting of book pages
* [Wikiti Pandoc Book Template](https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template)
