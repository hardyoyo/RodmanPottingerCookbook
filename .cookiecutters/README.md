# .cookiecutter Cookie templates

This project makes use of one template, [recipe](./recipe), for the
[cookie](https://github.com/bbugyi200/cookie) command line tool.

To use this template, copy the .cookiecutter folder to your HOME folder, or if
you already use cookiecutter, copy the recipe template to it.

Then you can create a new recipe by running the following command:

`cookie recipe NameOfRecipeInCamelCase.md`

Then enter the title, keywords, and servings, as prompted by the Cookie script.
